FlashCode: A Flashcard App Built By An MSSA Student for MSSA Students

As part of my midterm project for the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA), I designed and built **FlashCode** — a modular .NET MAUI desktop/mobile study app engineered specifically for students in the PCAD track.

FlashCode isn’t just a code trainer — it’s a community-driven platform that enables *anyone* in MSSA to build and contribute their own interactive C# flashcards using structured JSON files.

Project Overview

FlashCode reinforces C# mastery through guided repetition, syntax drills, algorithm walkthroughs, and whiteboard-style logic prompts.

It’s built with:

* .NET MAUI for cross-platform deployment
* C# 9 and XAML for a responsive, maintainable interface
* Structured JSON decks dynamically loaded and validated at runtime

Each flashcard is schema-bound and rendered by a modular engine that adapts based on card type — including assignment, syntax, method, and whiteboard prompts.

Why It Matters

FlashCode was shaped entirely by real student feedback.

I asked my MSSA peers how they actually study — what works, what doesn’t, and what’s missing. Common themes emerged:

* Syntax fades quickly without active recall
* Worksheets offer no feedback
* Lecture-only formats don’t scale
* Most tools aren’t designed around how developers think

FlashCode tackles this head-on with fill-in-the-blank challenges, immediate validation, targeted review queues, and hint-driven scaffolding — helping students move from passive recall to active fluency.

Built for Customization

Every card in FlashCode is defined in a structured JSON format.

That means any student, instructor, or study group can build custom decks — no compiler required. FlashCode interprets these files in real-time, and renders cards appropriately based on structure:

* Whiteboard cards explore some of the foundational interview strategies for structured problem breakdown
* MSSA Assignment cards emphasize applied problem-solving and map to Weeks 1 - 8 of the course
* Standalone syntax and method cards reinforce accuracy and pattern recognition

The goal: a sustainable, open framework for long-term technical growth — designed to evolve with each new MSSA cohort.

Interactive in All the Right Ways

FlashCode isn’t passive. Key features include:

* Real-time answer validation with visual feedback
* Mode toggling between syntax and method prompts
* A review system that reinforces missed content over time
* A “simulate bot” for performance testing
* Persistent performance tracking across decks and sessions

A Tool for the Whole Program

This wasn’t built in isolation. FlashCode is the product of peer input, iterative design, and problem-solving rooted in lived experience. It’s a tool I hope future MSSA students will not only use — but extend.

If you’re in MSSA now (or planning to be), this is for you.
If you teach or support the program, I’d be happy to show how easy it is to create or import structured decks.

Let’s raise the bar for how we retain and apply code — and make sure no one falls behind for lack of the right tools.

If you were designing a study tool for developers, what would you include?

I’d love to hear your ideas. FlashCode’s roadmap is shaped by real feedback — and your input matters.
