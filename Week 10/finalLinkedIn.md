FlashCode: Built By An MSSA Student for MSSA Students


My midterm project for the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA), FlashCode; a modular .NET MAUI desktop app engineered specifically for students in the PCAD track.


FlashCode isn’t just a code trainer; it’s a community-driven platform that enables anyone in MSSA to build and contribute their own interactive C# flashcards using structured JSON files.


It’s built with:

* .NET MAUI for cross-platform deployment

* C# and XAML for a responsive, maintainable interface

* Structured JSON decks dynamically loaded and validated at runtime


Each flashcard is schema-bound and rendered by a modular engine that adapts based on card type; including assignment, syntax, method, and whiteboard prompts.


FlashCode was shaped entirely by real student feedback.  I asked my MSSA peers how they actually study; what works, what doesn’t, and what’s missing. 


Common themes emerged:

* Syntax fades quickly without active recall

* Worksheets offer no feedback

* Lecture-only formats don’t scale

* Most tools aren’t designed around how developers think


FlashCode leverages fill-in-the-blank challenges, immediate validation, targeted review queues, and hint-driven scaffolding; helping students move from passive recall to active fluency.


Every card in FlashCode is defined in a structured JSON format. That means any student, instructor, or study group can build custom decks; no compiler required. FlashCode interprets these files in real-time, and renders cards appropriately based on structure:


* Whiteboard cards explore interview strategies for structured problem breakdown

* Assignment cards emphasize applied problem-solving in Weeks 1 - 8 of the course

* Syntax and method cards reinforce accuracy and pattern recognition


The goal: a sustainable, open framework for long-term technical growth;  designed to evolve with each new MSSA cohort.


Key features include:


* Real-time answer validation with visual feedback

* Mode toggling between syntax and method prompts

* A review system that reinforces missed content over time

* A “simulate bot” for performance testing

* Persistent performance tracking across decks and sessions


This wasn’t built in isolation. FlashCode is the product of peer input, iterative design, and problem-solving rooted in lived experience. It’s a tool I hope future MSSA students will use and contribute to!


If you’re in MSSA now (or planning to be), this is for you. If you teach or support the program, I’d be happy to show how easy it is to create or import structured decks.


If you were designing a study tool for developers, what would you include?


I’d love to hear your ideas. FlashCode’s roadmap is shaped by real feedback and YOUR INPUT MATTERS!
