### MSSA Final Project Audit — Functional Status vs Original MVP

This is a comprehensive audit of the current codebase and card assets vs the functional goals defined by the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Each feature is listed below with its **MVP goal**, current **implementation status**, and **recommendations** if any.

---

## 1. Card Types and JSON Integration

### MVP Goal:

Support structured learning cards across 5 content types: Assignments, Method Problems, Syntax Problems, Whiteboard Walkthroughs, and Review.

### Current Status:

* Fully implemented in `CardLoader.cs` with switch logic for loading:

  * `Assignments.json`
  * `methodCards.json`
  * `syntaxCards.json`
  * `whiteboard.json`

* `MainPage.xaml.cs` handles switching decks dynamically based on Picker selection

### No changes needed.

---

## 2. Prompt Rendering & Input Collection

### MVP Goal:

Show structured prompts with fill-in-the-blank entries and collect user input for validation.

### Current Status:

* Fully functional for `ProblemCard`, `AssignmentCard`, and `WhiteboardCard`:

  * Uses `PromptRenderer` to render input inline via regex for `___1___` syntax
  * Tracks inputs using `AnswerUtility.CollectAnswersFromLayout`

* Visual feedback using color-coded border highlights for answers is implemented.

### No changes needed.

---

## 3. Submission Validation + Feedback

### MVP Goal:

When user submits answers, validate against correct ones, highlight correctness, and show a message.

### Current Status:

* Validation logic uses exact match with case-insensitive comparison via `AnswerFeedback`
* `OnSubmitClicked()` in `MainPage.xaml.cs` correctly handles:

  * Syntax/method toggle logic
  * Highlighting fields
  * Review queue routing

### Issue noted:

* Answer highlight *was not* updating reliably due to possibly skipped controls in the `CollectEntriesRecursive` tree traversal.

  * **Now resolved**: Control detection covers `Border`, `ContentView`, `Entry`, and generic `Layout`

---

## 4. Review Mode (Toggleable)

### MVP Goal:

Cards missed on first try go into a review queue. Users can toggle into "Review Mode" to work through only those cards.

### Current Status:

* Fully working review queue system in `CardStateManager.cs`

  * Tracks review status per deck
  * Dynamically restores last seen index per deck
* Review label updates and visual cues implemented via `ReviewService.UpdateReviewLabel()`

### No changes needed.

---

## 5. Hint System

### MVP Goal:

Show hint button that toggles a helpful tip from the card.

### Current Status:

* Working through `HintRender.GetHint()`
* Conditioned by `modeSwitch` for assignments
* Toggled state managed in `MainPage.xaml.cs`

### No changes needed.

---

## 6. JSON Test Loader (Debugging Aid)

### MVP Goal:

Simple button to verify JSON file integrity and deserialization.

### Current Status:

* `OnTestAssignmentClicked` button loads first `AssignmentCard` via `JsonTester.cs`
* Useful for confirming resource linking is valid.

### No changes needed.

---

## 7. Visual Structure + Responsiveness

### MVP Goal:

Layout should support desktop-friendly formatting, responsive width on larger screens, and proper spacing.

### Current Status:

* Grid layout with separate prompt and input columns
* `ScrollView` and `VerticalStackLayout` for dynamic sizing
* Width control added (`MaximumWidthRequest=600`) for desktop polish
* Recent fix to `submitButton` spacing applied

### No major issues.

---

## 8. Debug Logging (Console + UI)

### MVP Goal:

Track internal status and errors.

### Current Status:

* `DebugLogger` writes to console and optionally to a UI label

### Suggestion:

* Hook `OutputLabel = feedbackLabel` back in `MainPage.xaml.cs` constructor for visual feedback during testing.

---

## 9. Model Classes (ICard + Variants)

### MVP Goal:

All cards must conform to `ICard` interface with `Id`, `DisplayTitle`, and `DisplayBody()`.

### Current Status:

* Implemented fully:

  * `AssignmentCard`, `MethodCard`, `ProblemCard`, `SyntaxCard`, `WhiteboardCard`
* AssignmentCards contain both `methodProblem` and `syntaxProblem` blocks.

### No changes needed.
