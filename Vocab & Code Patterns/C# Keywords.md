# C# Keywords and Functions â€“ Assignments 1.1 & 1.2

| Keyword/Function | Definition |
|------------------|------------|
| `using` | Directive to include namespaces that provide access to classes and methods. |
| `namespace` | Defines a logical grouping for related classes and methods to avoid naming conflicts. |
| `class` | Defines a container for methods and fields; used to build objects or group logic. |
| `public` | Makes a class or method accessible from outside its current file or namespace. |
| `static` | Means the method or variable belongs to the class itself rather than an instance. |
| `void` | Specifies that a method does not return any value. |
| `int` | Used to store whole numbers like 1, 42, or -7. |
| `double` | Used to store decimal numbers, more precise than int. |
| `string` | Stores text, like names or typed input. |
| `bool` | Stores true/false values for logic decisions. |
| `List<T>` | A growable collection used to store multiple values of the same type. |
| `Console.WriteLine()` | Displays a line of output to the console and moves to the next line. |
| `Console.Write()` | Displays text to the console without adding a new line. |
| `Console.ReadLine()` | Waits for the user to type something and hit enter, then returns it as text. |
| `TryParse` | Tries to convert text into a number or other type safely, without crashing. |
| `Parse` | Converts text into a number or other type, but will crash if the input is invalid. |
| `out` | Used with TryParse to store the result if the conversion succeeds. |
| `if` | Runs a block of code only when a specific condition is true. |
| `else` | Runs a different block of code if the `if` condition was false. |
| `switch` | A way to check many possible values of a variable and pick one block of code to run. |
| `case` | Each possible match in a switch statement. |
| `default` | Runs if no switch case matches. |
| `while` | Repeats a block of code while a condition is true. |
| `while (true)` | A loop that keeps running until you manually stop it. |
| `for` | A loop that runs a specific number of times, often using a counter. |
| `break` | Exits the current loop or switch statement. |
| `continue` | Skips the rest of the loop body and starts the next loop cycle. |
| `return` | Ends the current method and optionally sends a value back. |
| `Environment.Exit()` | Closes the entire program. |
| `Count` | Returns the number of items in a list. |
| `foreach` | Loops through every item in a collection. |
| `+` | Adds two values. |
| `-` | Subtracts one value from another. |
| `*` | Multiplies two values. |
| `/` | Divides one value by another. |
| `%` | Returns the remainder of a division. |
| `==` | Checks if two values are exactly the same. |
| `!=` | Checks if two values are not the same. |
| `<` | Checks if the left side is less than the right. |
| `<=` | Checks if the left side is less than or equal to the right. |
| `>` | Checks if the left side is greater than the right. |
| `>=` | Checks if the left side is greater than or equal to the right. |
| `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` | Checks if a string is null, empty, or only whitespace. |
| `Thread.Sleep()` | Pauses the program for a specific number of milliseconds. |
